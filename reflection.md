Why will the quiz thing not have borders show up???
Why do I have to enable the border style to be solid? Is a solid border not default?

Why is the br element practically non-existant??? How does it not space things at all?
That was silly, of course it doesn't space things it is just a line break...

Why can I not change the font weight?? They should be scalable no? are they not opentype or cleartype whatever? why does font weight of change nothing but 800 does change things?



I am really happy with everything except the font weight in the example image all of the text looks slightly more bold than in mine and I tried a bunch of different ways and could not figure out how to scale up the text slightly because the fonts would want to snap to specific sizings. If this could be explained in class that would be great!

Also because I had my screen zommed in I got rid of the picture at first but then I realized it was still there just off to the size so I returned it :)

I started writing comments for the code but then I got really lazy and stopped, please feel free to ask me questions about my code though.
